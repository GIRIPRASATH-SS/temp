Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to running the modified code that reads the CSV from a URL using PySpark:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install pyspark requests
```

Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries
Create a Python script (e.g., `spark_script.py`) and import the required libraries:
```python
import requests
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
```

Step 3: Initialize SparkSession
Initialize a SparkSession, which is the entry point for interacting with Spark:
```python
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Spark Assignment").getOrCreate()
```

Step 4: Read the CSV from URL
```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming/master/adult_data.csv"
response = requests.get(url)
content = response.text

df = spark.read.csv(spark.sparkContext.parallelize(content.splitlines()), header=True, inferSchema=True)
```

Step 5: Register the DataFrame as a temporary table
To perform SQL operations on the DataFrame, register it as a temporary table using the `createOrReplaceTempView()` method:
```python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("adult_data")
```

Step 6: Perform SQL operations
Now you can execute SQL queries on the registered table. Here are the two queries you need:

Query 1: Find the average age of males and females
```python
average_age_query = """
    SELECT gender, AVG(age) AS average_age
    FROM adult_data
    GROUP BY gender
"""
average_age_result = spark.sql(average_age_query)
average_age_result.show()
```

Query 2: Find the total number of people where the workclass parameter is 'Private'
```python
private_count_query = """
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
    FROM adult_data
    WHERE workclass = 'Private'
"""
private_count_result = spark.sql(private_count_query)
private_count_result.show()
```

Step 7: Summarize your understanding
After executing the queries, you can summarize your understanding of Spark Architecture and the benefits of the SQL API by adding your own comments or print statements in the script.

Step 8: Run the script
Save the script and run it using the Python interpreter:
```
python spark_script.py
```

Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to access the CSV file from the provided URL.

That's it! The script will fetch the CSV content from the URL, read it into a DataFrame, execute the SQL queries, and display the results. Let me know if you have any further questions!
